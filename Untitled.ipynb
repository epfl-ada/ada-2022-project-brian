    "2) That you understand what’s in the data (formats, distributions, missing values, correlations, etc.).\n",
    "3) That you considered ways to enrich, filter, transform the data according to your needs.\n",
    "4) That you have a reasonable plan and ideas for methods you’re going to use, giving their essential mathematical details in the notebook.\n",

    "We will evaluate this milestone according to how well these steps have been done and documented, the quality of the code and its documentation, the feasibility and critical awareness of the project. We will also evaluate this milestone according to how clear, reasonable, and well thought-through the project idea is. Please use the second milestone to really check with us that everything is in order with your project (idea, feasibility, etc.) before you advance too much with the final Milestone P3! There will be project office hours dedicated to helping you."
